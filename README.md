# DATA DRIVEN PAKISTAN

After collecting and cleaning open government data, we build engaging, interactive data visualizations with the goal of making boring ol' government data more interesting and hopefully sparking further discussion and research amongst citizens.

## Getting Started

Clone gh-pages branch of project to your local machine.
Create a new branch before beginning any work.
In command prompt (or Terminal in VS Studio Code), go to project folder and launch project with this: python -m http.server.

### Prerequisites

In order to run project on local machine, you will need to have python3 installed.
(I think everything else is included as a download in project itself but this is the first time I've had to write a README for this project so I might be missing things because they seem so obvious. If so, please let me know.)

### Installing
